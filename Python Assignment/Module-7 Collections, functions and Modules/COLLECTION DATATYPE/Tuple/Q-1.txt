Q - Introduction to tuples, immutability.

Tuples are known due to immutability which makes a tuple faster than lists.

Tuples allows you to store multiple items in a single variable.

You can add multiple datatypes in tuple.

Tuples are immutable, which means once you create a tuple, you cannot change, add, or remove its elements.

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable(immutable), and allow duplicate values.

Tuples are indexed. Elements in a tuple have a defined order, so each item has an index starting from 0.

This immutability makes tuples a bit more efficient in memory usage and provides added security for data that shouldnâ€™t be modified.
