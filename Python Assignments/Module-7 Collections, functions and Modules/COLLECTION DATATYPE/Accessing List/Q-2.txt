Q - Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing).

1) Positive indexing : Positive indexing starts from 0, then 1 2 and so on. 
The first element of list is at 0 index and the second element is at 1 index.

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(my_list[0])
    this will print first element from the list which is 10 in the output.

print(my_list[1])
    this code will print 2nd position element of the list which is 20.

2) Negative indexing : The negative indexing starts from -1, which will give you the last element from the list and -2 for second last element and so on.

print(my_list[-1])
    this will print 40 from the list.
    
print(my_list[-1])
    this will print 30 from the list.
