Q - Defining functions in Python.

Function is a block of code which we can use again and again. 

Function makes code easy to understand and reduces code.

Function is used to manage large code and make code more readable.

There are 2 steps to implement a function.
    1. function definition : main block of code
    2. function calling : to use function

Function is declared by def keyword.

Syntax:
    # function definition
    def func_name():
        code to be executed

    # function calling
    func_name()
