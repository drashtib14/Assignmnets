Q - Introduction to SQLite3 and PyMySQL for database connectivity.

Python provides libraries like SQLite3 and PyMySQL to interact with databases.
SQLite3 is used for small to medium-sized applications or when you need a database without a separate server.


PyMySQL allows Python programs to interact with MySQL servers for more complex and larger-scale applications.

Basic Steps in PyMySQL:
    1. Install PyMySQL (pip install pymysql).
    2. Connect to the MySQL server (host, user, password, database).
    3. Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands.
    4. Perform database operations.
    5. Commit changes and close the connection.
