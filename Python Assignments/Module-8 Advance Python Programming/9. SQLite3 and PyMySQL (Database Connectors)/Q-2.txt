Q - Creating and executing SQL queries from Python using these connectors.

1. Using SQLite3 :

Steps to Execute SQL Queries with SQLite3:
    1. Connect to the Database: Use sqlite3.connect() to connect to a database (or create one if it doesnâ€™t exist).
    2. Create a Cursor Object: Use connection.cursor() to execute SQL queries.
    3. Write and Execute Queries:
        1. Use execute() for single queries.
        2. Use executemany() for multiple queries.
    4. Commit Changes: Save changes using connection.commit().
    5. Fetch Results: Use methods like fetchone(), fetchall(), etc.
    6. Close the Connection: Use connection.close().


2. Using PyMySQL :

Steps to Execute SQL Queries with PyMySQL:
    1. Connect to the Database: Use pymysql.connect() with the host, username, password, and database name.
    2. Create a Cursor Object: Use connection.cursor() to execute SQL queries.
    3. Write and Execute Queries:
        1. Use execute() for single queries.
        2. Use executemany() for multiple queries.
    4. Commit Changes: Save changes using connection.commit().
    5. Fetch Results: Retrieve data using methods like fetchone(), fetchall(), etc.
    6. Close the Connection: Use connection.close().
