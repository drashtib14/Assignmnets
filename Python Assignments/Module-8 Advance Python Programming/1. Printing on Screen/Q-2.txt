Q - Formatting outputs using f-strings and format().

f-string :
f-strings are a concise and efficient way to format strings in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.6.

e.g:
    print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

format() :
The format() method formats strings by replacing values into placeholders {}.
Values are passed as arguments to the format() method, which fills in the placeholders in the string.

e.g:
    print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format("Drashti", 21))
