Q - Reading from a file using read(), readline(), readlines().

The methods read(), readline(), and readlines() are used to read the contents of a file in different ways.

1. read() :
    Reads the entire content of a file as a single string.

2. readline() :
    Reads one line from the file at a time.
    Each call to readline() moves to the next line.

3. readlines() :
    Reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings.
    each string in the list represents a single line, including the newline character (\n).
