Q - Difference between local and global variables.

Local variable :
    Local variables are declared inside a function or block and can only be accessed within that function or block.
    They exist only while the function is executing and are destroyed once the function ends.

Global variable :
    Global variables are declared outside of all functions or blocks and can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program.
    They exist for the duration of the programâ€™s execution.
