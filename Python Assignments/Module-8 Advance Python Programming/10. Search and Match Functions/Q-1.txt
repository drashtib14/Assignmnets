Q - Using re.search() and re.match() functions in Pythonâ€™s re module for pattern matching.

re which means Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
re is an in-built function which is used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

re.search() and re.match() both functions return a match object if a match is found otherwise they return None.


re.search() :
    The search() function will go through the entire string for the first occurrence of the pattern.


re.match() :
    The match() function attempts to match a pattern only at the beginning of the string.
