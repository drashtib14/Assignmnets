Q - Introduction to exceptions and how to handle them using try, except, and finally.

Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program.
They interrupt the normal flow of the program, but you can handle them using try and except block.

Try block contains your main code and except handles errors if any occurs and finally always executes code wether the code runs or gives an exception.


e.g :
    try:
    # main code
    except ExceptionType:
        # code to handle the exception
    finally:
        # code that always runs in both conditions
