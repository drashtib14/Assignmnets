Q - Opening files in different modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', 'w+').


The open() function is used to open files in various modes.
open() takes 2 arguments. First is filename and second is mode.
The mode defines how the file should be handled whether it’s for reading, writing or appending.

Modes :
    'r'  : Opens the file for reading. Default mode. File must exist.
    'w'  : Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist, or overwrites if it does.
    'a'  : Opens the file for appending. Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist. Appends data to the end without overwriting.
    'r+' : Opens the file for both reading and writing. File must exist.
    'w+' : Opens the file for both reading and writing. Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist, or overwrites it.
